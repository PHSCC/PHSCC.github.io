    <p>This is where I post all of the Computer Science Work I've made over the course of this year, and random other things that make me proud. </p>    <br>

      <p>This creation was a collaboration with my friend Sebastian Franco, for our computer science project, we chose to recreate a Russian card game, Durak, in scratch, and in doing so we completely rewrote our code sevreal times until finally we compressed all of the game engine into only 46 unique scripts, as compared to the originial 130, which stil lacked several features. All in all this project was a huge success for our skill level and we are both proud of what we accomplished with minimal instruction.</p>

      <p>This game sends a new arrow in the dancing game every second, in order to make the girl dance, or shake in denial according to the accuracy of the “dancing” according to the blue line, with a difficulty that ramps up as you get better. </p>

      <p>This is what happens when I get bored, I decided to 3D model a Brig (as in a two masted boat), and once I finished and was satisfied with how it turned out in a program, I immediately wanted to be able to hold it and be able to enjoy a real life model of a brig. And so, because I am far too cheap to buy a 3D printer, I instead opted to print out every polygon and attach them with tape, ending in a huge success as the structure holds and in my eyes, is impressive. </p>
